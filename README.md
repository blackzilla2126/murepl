# murepl

MUREPL is a proof-of-concept Clojure REPL / Multi User Dungeon that
runs in the browser. It was built for Clojure Cup 2013 and came in
second place.

After the initial 48 hours of development MUREPL worked and was,
subjectively, fun. But it was essentially a gamification of one giant
security whole since I didn't have time to come up with a sandboxing
system.

It also crashes for other reasons and is in general pretty rough
around the edges.

MUREPL's real life is just beginning as it will be improved and
stabilized post-competition.

A development MUREPL instance runs at
[http://murepl.chiptheglasses.com](http://murepl.chiptheglasses.com). It's
usually up but don't be surprised if you get a 502. A "real" instance
of MUREPL will run one day.
